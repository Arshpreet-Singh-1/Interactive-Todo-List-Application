## Instructions

### Setup

 - **Begin with an HTML file (`index.html`):** Create the foundation of your todo list app.
 - **Create a basic CSS file (`style.css`):** Style the todo list elements.
 - **Set up the HTML structure:** Include a heading, input field for adding tasks, an add button, and an empty unordered list (`<ul>`).

### Variables

 - **Create variables:** Within the JavaScript file (`script.js`), reference the todo list (`<ul>`), input field, and add button elements.

### Add Todo Function

-  **Write a function (`addTodo`):** Execute it when the add button is clicked.
-  **Inside the function:** Store the value of the input field in a variable and empty the input field.

### Create New Todo Item

-  **Within `addTodo` function:** Create new elements for the todo item â€” a list item (`<li>`), a span for the task content, and a delete button.
-  **Append elements:** Add the span and delete button as children of the list item.

### Set Text Content

 - **Set text content:** Assign the value of the input field to the span (the todo task) and set the text content of the delete button to 'Delete'.

### Append to List

-  **Append list item:** Add the list item as a child of the todo list (`<ul>`).

### Delete Todo Item

-  **Attach event listener:** Add it to the delete button so that when clicked, it removes the corresponding todo item.

### Mark Todo as Completed (Optional)

-  **Implement functionality:** Mark todo items as completed by adding a checkbox or toggle button.
-  **Styling:** Update the appearance of completed tasks to differentiate them from active tasks.

### Focus on Input Field

- **Use `focus()` method:** Focus the input field, ready for entering the next todo item.
